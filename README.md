With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility \m/

This repository contains the scripts and the results we got when using way points
to generate the path followed by buses in the urban area of Antanarivo.

* getwaypoints.py : extract way points from the url contained in the file whose name is provided as command line argument
* directions.py : generate an HTML file with the Map showing the path
* change_api_key.sh : script itented to replace YOUR_API_KEY by a real API KEY

Get API KEY : https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key?hl=En
